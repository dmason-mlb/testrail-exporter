For details on \"Voice Recognition Title Name\", refer to \"Voice Recognition Title Name User's Guide\". Up to three voice recognition title names can be set for each language supported by voice recognition.\r\n\r\nTo avoid end user confusion, a number representing a series or a number/expression representing a year alone must be prevented from being set as a voice recognition title name. Because there are many applications that include \"2015\", \"III\", and \"2K14\"; when only setting these as voice recognition texts, multiple applications will be applicable and user experience will be compromised.\r\n\r\nNote that languages according to sales region are required. For example, setting an English (UK) voice recognition title name will be required for SIEE applications, even for applications that only support Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe use of hiragana and katakana is recommended for Japanese phoneme creation. A phoneme created with Japanese set does not violate this requirement even if romaji or English spelling is used; however, recognition precision may deteriorate.\r\n\r\nIf it will be difficult to conform to this requirement in applications that re-use masters, contact Private Support through the PlayStation®4 Developer Network website (https://ps4.scedev.net//) in advance.\r\n",

Hangs and the application becoming inoperable must not occur at this time.

When we do in fact need to check for this case we may need help understanding this case.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nThe user assigned to PlayStation®VR can perform gameplay in a state where the user's own eye-to-eye distance is measured in \"Settings\" > \"Devices\" > \"PlayStation®VR\" > \"Measure Eye-to-Eye Distance\" in the system software and the measurement is registered in the system software. Application developers must consider these requirements when implementing VR applications.\r\n",

Applications developers must use \"★Debug Settings\" to set a value in this range and confirm that applications operate properly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the system software retains the eye-to-eye distance of unmeasured users as a default value (63 mm). A PlayStation®VR user is not necessarily always using applications with their eye-to-eye distance measured by the system software, therefore application developers must perform testing for arbitrary users in consideration of both when the default eye-to-eye distance is applied and when the eye-to-eye distance measured for each user is applied.\r\n\r\nThe assigned user for PlayStation®VR can be checked in the screen displayed in \"Quick Menu\" > \"Switch User\". In this screen, the user with the PlayStation®VR icon displayed will be the user assigned to PlayStation®VR.",
