This will be similar to the Highmark batch. \n* EBIS information as well as any social media information available from Baseball data should be compiled and sent. \n* Presumably, we will also need a way to \"remove\" players from consideration in FAMA's system when they have the checkbox unchecked on their profile. \n* JoAnn and Jose have worked on delivering a one time dump to FAMA in the past so are best to reach out to with technical questions.\n* Whatever solution is arrived at - we need to ensure that it is either not run in lower environments, or that if it is run in a lower environment that it is NOT actually sent to FAMA. We would only want production data to reach them. \n\n*Note that this is entirely new and I am sure there will be outstanding requirements questions that we need to revisit with users*",
