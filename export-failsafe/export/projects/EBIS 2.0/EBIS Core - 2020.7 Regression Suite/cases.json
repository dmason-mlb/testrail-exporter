We have a fairly time-sensitive project we are completing presently that requires this information. Additionally, when I attempted a workaround using the Multi-Year report, it appeared to provide incomplete information (e.g. it shows us having just a $25m payroll in 2015). \n\nIs this a known issue already, and is it possible to get that resolved today?",
