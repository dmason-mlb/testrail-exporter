If the player is added in the off season, the new club will start counting as of the first day of the major league season.\n## If the player elects free agency with type XIXA(2) from the new club and there is still time remaining on the prior clubâ€™s terminated contract - that club will continue to count dues days starting with the date the player elects free agency.\n\n\n\nWe will be displaying Dues Days on the player profile service tab in both the major league summary widget - showing each orgâ€™s total for the year and in the breakdown widget - in a column with an increasing count with the org specified. \n\n\n\nJeff sent in the following request via SNOW:\nReceived from: jeff.pfeifer@mlb.com\nRecipients: ebissupport@mlb.com,travis.buck@mlb.com,Garrett.Horan@mlb.com,jeff.pfeifer@mlb.com,rreuter@lbisoftware.com,matthew.salvatore@mlb.com,Vanish.Grover@mlb.com,Paul.Mifsud@mlb.com\n\nEBIS â€“ \n\nFor 2022, we will need to create a â€œDues Daysâ€� field in eBIS that counts number of days during season where player is paid his ML salaryâ€¦including days after release. This field should be located in the Service tab (see below).Â  Additionally, could we have a day by day breakdown column added to the service breakdown utility in the service tab > (see below).\n\nSee the attached for detailed guidelines.Â  For this purpose, the day of option (whether pre or post game) will be a ML pay day (dues day).Â  Also, if a player is designated off the ML Active roster, the days designated should be included.Â  If designated off option, the designated days should not be included.\n\nLike we do for MLS, could we also have it broken down by Club in any year in which the player is with more than one Club?Â  \n\nThanks\\!\n\nThis will likely be broken up into further stories, just entering this as a placeholder so it doesn't get lost",
