Instead ebis will send updates directly to BCBS in the form of a JSON file.  \n\n<The method of sending is TBD as is the file format>\n\nIn order to allow the new process to work the highmark batch will need to be updated to NOT update the playerâ€™s MnInsFlag, MnInsDt, and MNInsOverrideFlag.  It should still do everything else, but those updates and the ebis link cache should be removed.\n\nThe new batch will use a view modeled after the existing highmark batch view and should perform the existing updates which were removed from the highmark batch.\n\nIn addition to sending over the nightly changes, BCBS has requested that file consist of EVERY player currently receiving MN Ins with each run, so a new section of the view will need to pull in everyone who currently has MN ins set to YES.  \n\nThe JSON file will consist of a single record per player and then any changes they have will be sent in a sublist.
