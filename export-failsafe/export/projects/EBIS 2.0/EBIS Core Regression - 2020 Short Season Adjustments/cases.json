As more Clubs‰Ûª payrolls have been proximate to the CBT threshold, we would like to revisit the way we account for cash on the Payrolls reports when it is run ‰ÛÏas of‰Û� a certain date. Right now, my understanding is that EBIS has some fairly convoluted back-end logic to calculate the CBT allocations on multi-year cash transactions, and there‰Ûªs not really any way we can update the resulting calculations.\r\r\r\rWhat I would like to do, if possible, is apply that same logic to an additional feature on each Outright (Trade) page. What I‰Ûªm envisioning, on the Mookie Betts trade as an example, would be an additional collapsible section titled ‰ÛÏCash Payroll Allocations‰Û� for trades that include cash considerations. This section would have the same back-end logic that EBIS has now, except only BOC users could adjust the yearly allocations. When running payrolls ‰ÛÏas of‰Û� a certain date, the cash would pull from the allocations assigned to each trade page rather than the back-end logic. Basically, it would give us the ability to make manual adjustments to cash, which many Clubs have requested.\r\r\r\rLet me know if there‰Ûªs a good time in early March to discuss this new feature, and I can put together a more robust description of the desired functionality in the interim.\r\r\r\r\r\rThanks,\r\rCameron",
