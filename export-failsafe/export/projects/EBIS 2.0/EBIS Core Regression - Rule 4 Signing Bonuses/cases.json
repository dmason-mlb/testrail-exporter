This date is shown in the first line of the header summary\r- The Actual Signing Bonus pool is the shown in the Header Summary Box under 'Signing Bonus Pool'.\r- A club typically begins with an Actual Signing Bonus Pool of zero. This is because the Signing Bonus Value is only counted towards the Actual Signing Bonus Pool when a Player has been signed for that Overall Pick that the Signing Bonus Value is associated with.\r- However, if a player drafted in rounds up to round 10 is marked as NSD, that player's bonus value is included in the 'Signing Bonus Pool' box for the Signing Deadline row in the Summary box.\r-  Therefore, the Actual Signing Bonus Pool as of the Signing Deadline is calculated as the total of the \"Signing Bonus Values\" for rows which have a Signed Date plus the signing bonus values of any players who are marked as NSD\rFor example:\rThe Yankees have 10 bonus values as they drafted 10 players upto Round 10. They signed 7 of their picks, 2 picks are marked as NSD, and 1 pick was not signed. Their Signing Bonus Pool as of the Signing Deadline is:\rSum of bonus values of 7 guys who signed + sum of bonus values of 2 guys who were NSD",
