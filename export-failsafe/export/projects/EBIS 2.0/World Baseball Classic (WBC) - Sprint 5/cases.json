Whenever a profile is created all of these must stay in sync in order to retain consistency in our data. This is slightly error-prone and can be refactored.\n\nThe goal is to go from 4 objects representing a player to having 1 table represent it. To do so weâ€™ll shift the models focus onto the Profile which we believe represents the basic unit at play in wbc.\n\nDoing so, matching logic will be impacted and will have to change slightly.\n\n\n\nAC:\n\n* Everything continues to work as is\n** Creating a new Player with and without matches\n** Saving Player Profiles",
