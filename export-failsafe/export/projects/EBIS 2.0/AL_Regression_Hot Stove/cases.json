    "custom_steps": "Currently in the Intl Signing Bonus Utility, the bonus pools just have the concept of an \"original\" flag in them.  This drives the max allowable pool amount - both the value on the UI, as well as underlying rule checks on Trades.  BOC Users would like more control/flexibility in what drives this max allowable pool amount.\n\n1 - Update the system value, go from a percentage to a multiplier.  Currently it is 75 for 2018, it should be 1.75 instead.  Same with the years going forward.\n2 - Add a new field to the Signing Bonus Pool section -> *Amount Towards Max* \n    - When we create original pool entries at the beginning of the signing period, we will use the system value associated with the given year to calculate Amount Towards Max.  For example, if the Amount field is $1,000,000, then Amount Towards Max will be $1,750,000 (1,000,000 * 1.75).\n    - If a new row is created, and \"Original Pool\" is checked, we will again drive off of the same system value for the current year.  Currently (in 2018) it is .75.   \n    - If a Trade is created, the Amount Towards Max field will be $0.\n    - If a manual row is added to the Pool section, Amount Towards Max will be equal to Amount.  So, if the Amount is $1,000,000, Amount Towards Max will be $1,000,000 as well.\n\n3 - This new field will be editable only by BOC users (same as current pool section)\n4 - If the Amount field is edited, we should recalculate the Amount Towards Max field, with the same rules as from #2.\n5 - We should increase the limit of the Description field up to 200 characters, and allow more room for it on the screen.\n6 - The rules that referenced the Maximum Allowable Pool value will now just take the sum of all of the *Amount Towards Max* values from the signing bonus pool section.\n7 - The UI will also just take the sum of all of the *Amount Towards Max* values from the signing bonus pool section.\n8 - Create a data fix to update the values for *Amount Towards Max* in the existing entries from 2017 and 2018 - so they are equivalent to what we have now in Ebis2.\n9 - research when pools are created for first time\n\nReferenced jira:  https://jira.boc.mlb.com:8443/browse/EBISII-15468",
