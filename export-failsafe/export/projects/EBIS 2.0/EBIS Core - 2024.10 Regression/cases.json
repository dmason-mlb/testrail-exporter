To clarify, if the player is optioned \"post-game\", that day counts as an active day. If a player is optioned without the post-game checked, that does not count as an active day. If the player is outrighted \"post-game\", that day counts as an active day. If a player is outrighted without the post-game checked, that does not count as an active day. An active day will not be counted for any day there is any other transaction for that player (iplacement to an IL, Paternity or Bereavement List or to any Inactive List (Restricted, Admin Leave, etc.)",
