BOC users can modify the value at any time and their updates will be preserved.  \r\r\r\rAC:\r\r\r\rWhen there is a games adjustment in the the year the value originally calculated will follow the following logic:\r\r* For non innings pitched thresholds, apply the games divisor to the threshold total and then always rounded up to the next integer.  Example: 10 Games Played * 60 / 162 = ~3.7 Games Played -> New threshold is rounded up to 4 Games played \r\r* For innings pitched thresholds, convert the innings pitched to outs, apply the games divisor to the outs and round up to the nearest integer.  Then convert that back into innings pitched.  Example: 10 IP = 30 outs, 30 * .37 = ~11.1, 11.1 rounds up to 12, 12/3 = 4, so show 4.0 innings pitched.  Note that innings pitched could come out to 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, etc\r\r* For multi year bonus terms that include an adjusted year (2020) and any terms that do not include an adjusted year, the adjusted threshold will remain the original threshold value\r\r* The value will only be calculated once and then once it has been set will no longer be updated even if the games values change.  \r\r* The user can change the value as necessary and the system will not recalculate it\r\r* Clearing the value will cause the system to recalculate it and set the appropriate value\r\r* The MJ Stat batch will use the adjusted thresholds when checking to see if a bonus is earned\r\r* For multi year bonuses that included an adjusted year, the MJ Stat batch will continue to prorate the adjusted year's stats portion.
