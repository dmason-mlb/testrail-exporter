Selecting this report from the widget will launch the prompts according to the requirements. \n* The category of this report should be \"Pro Player Management\". \n* Entering the desired prompts and running the report will work and match the requirements. \n* The report will have an LDAP associated with it. Please provide the LDAP when the story is delivered and a user id to test the report and security with. \n* Please note the details around formatting provided at the top of the Report Details document, and the fact that the prompts allowed will vary based on the user type. \n\n*For QA* - This report needs to be compared with the current winter league portal version of the report. We are not building out all of the prompts at this time so we will need to discuss the best way to test/compare. We are only testing this for MLB Club/BOC users for this release.",
