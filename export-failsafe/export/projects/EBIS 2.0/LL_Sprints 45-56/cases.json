Would it be possible, as a one-time fix, to include an additional $2,000,000 cash line item for the Longoria cash transaction on CBT payrolls only (debit to TB, credit to SF)? This amount was used to offset Longoriaâ€™s earned assignment bonus and is part of an unusual situation where cash is not treated on an AAV basis for CBT. No worries if you guys arenâ€™t able to make this ad hoc adjustment, but I figured I would ask.\n\nIdea from Scott: \nwe could give them a way to get \"extra\" cash line items onto the regular payroll reports\nwe could create a simple table where we would manually add entries\nand that table would be included in the query for that section of the report",
