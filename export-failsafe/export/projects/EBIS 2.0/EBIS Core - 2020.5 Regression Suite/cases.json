Instead the agreement states that the bonus value should be prorated by using the following formula:\radjusted threshold / original threshold * earned bonus amount - in general this will come out fairly close to the actual calculation, however the rounding is done on the threshold side which leads to slightly different values.\r\rWhen the bonus is an innings pitched bonus, it should use .333333 and .666666 for the adjusted threshold rather than .1 and .2.\r\rIf a bonus has criteria which span multiple years, the adjusted earned bonus amount will be reduced based on the total # of games played by the total # of games in each season.  Since 2019 was 162 games and 2020 will be 60, a 2019-2020 bonus earned in 2020 will be adjusted by (162+60) / (162+162) = 0.68 * actual earned bonus amount\r\rIf the bonus has more than one term, then the basic adjustment will be applied\r\rThe offered bonus adjusted amounts on the summary screen should reflect the same logic, both in the total‰Ûªs at the top and in the perf and other bonus sections below.  (this may be subject to changed based on what‰Ûªs possible, I‰Ûªll try to update appropriately)\r\rExample calc from Cameron:\rCollin McHugh, his first amount should be: (6/15) * $100,000 = $40,000. The only caveat to this is that on the IP bonuses, the decimals used should be .3333 and .6666 (rather than .1 and .2). For instance, on McHugh‰Ûªs first IP threshold, his earned amount should be: (11.3333/30) * $250,000 = $94,444.\r\rAC:\r\r* earned bonus amount adjusted is calculated using the ratio of adj threshold to threshold\r* Innings pitched uses 1/3 and 2/3 rather that .1 and .2 when making the calculation \r* Bonuses with Multi year criteria are adjusted using all year‰Ûªs in the proration (and do not take the adjusted threshold into account)\r* Bonuses with multiple criteria will have the basic adjustment applied\r* Summary screen now displays offered adjusted bonus values and they match the values from the contract screen",
