As more Clubsâ€™ payrolls have been proximate to the CBT threshold, we would like to revisit the way we account for cash on the Payrolls reports when it is run â€œas ofâ€� a certain date. Right now, my understanding is that EBIS has some fairly convoluted back-end logic to calculate the CBT allocations on multi-year cash transactions, and thereâ€™s not really any way we can update the resulting calculations.\n\nWhat I would like to do, if possible, is apply that same logic to an additional feature on each Outright (Trade) page. What Iâ€™m envisioning, on the Mookie Betts trade as an example, would be an additional collapsible section titled â€œCash Payroll Allocationsâ€� for trades that include cash considerations. This section would have the same back-end logic that EBIS has now, except only BOC users could adjust the yearly allocations. When running payrolls â€œas ofâ€� a certain date, the cash would pull from the allocations assigned to each trade page rather than the back-end logic. Basically, it would give us the ability to make manual adjustments to cash, which many Clubs have requested.\n\nLet me know if thereâ€™s a good time in early March to discuss this new feature, and I can put together a more robust description of the desired functionality in the interim.\n\nThanks,\nCameron",
