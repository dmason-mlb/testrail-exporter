The service time season clock starts on the first day of the regular season. The season clock weâ€™re looking for, however, starts on the first day of Spring Training. Is there any way you could calculate a column called â€œduty daysâ€� for us based on this instead of service time?\r\no\tThe MN piece is called â€œDays with Clubâ€� on the last tab. This could be the piece we use to calculate duty days, but I would like to know where the clock starts. Is it the day you were assigned there? Date of Spring Training start? Date of the first game? Ideally we should try to get this in line with what I mentioned above.\r\no\tOnce we settle on a good duty day calculation, we will have to calculate playersâ€™ % of duty days in CA in their last year with the CA affiliate or Club. We could take the days and divide them by 365 to get a %. To identify these players, can you add a current status for each player (such as voluntarily retired, inactive, etc.) and then calculate this for their last season? If this is too much to do in the report we generate, I can probably calculate it it myself, but at minimum Iâ€™ll need the current status for each player\r\nâ€¢\tSeason calculations:\r\no\tFirst tab columns C and D (Major League CA years/days, which tie back to the second tab), are going to need tweaking. Pull up Rich Aurilia on the second tab and youâ€™ll see what I mean.\r\nï‚§\tIf we can get the â€œduty dayâ€� calculation instead of service time, can we add however many days span start of spring training to end of regular season = 1 season?\r\nï‚§\tIf not, and it has to be based on service time: As stated, 172 ML service days constitutes 1 ML service year. For Aurilia, youâ€™ll see he has 10 years with 172, and 3 incomplete years (one with 171, one with 28, and one with 65). Since he played parts of 13 seasons in CA, weâ€™ll want the first tab to show that. However it is saying 11 years and 92 days. Looks like you get this by taking the days from his 3 incomplete years (264, which is the same as 172+92). So youâ€™re tacking on one year to his existing 10 to get 11 years, and have 92 days left over.\r\nâ€¢\tSorry for not mentioning before, but not only do we want CA related days and seasons, we would like you to include columns for a playerâ€™s total days and seasons, so we can subtract and calculate non-CA related days and seasons (if you could do this directly in the report too that would be great).\r\nâ€¢\tThird tab:\r\no\tCan we add â€œClub Stateâ€� column next to A so we can have some way of bifurcating between CA affiliates and non-CA affiliates for CA Clubs\r\no\tCan we convert â€œOrg IDâ€� to MLB Club",

As more Clubs‰Ûª payrolls have been proximate to the CBT threshold, we would like to revisit the way we account for cash on the Payrolls reports when it is run ‰ÛÏas of‰Û� a certain date. Right now, my understanding is that EBIS has some fairly convoluted back-end logic to calculate the CBT allocations on multi-year cash transactions, and there‰Ûªs not really any way we can update the resulting calculations.\r\r\r\rWhat I would like to do, if possible, is apply that same logic to an additional feature on each Outright (Trade) page. What I‰Ûªm envisioning, on the Mookie Betts trade as an example, would be an additional collapsible section titled ‰ÛÏCash Payroll Allocations‰Û� for trades that include cash considerations. This section would have the same back-end logic that EBIS has now, except only BOC users could adjust the yearly allocations. When running payrolls ‰ÛÏas of‰Û� a certain date, the cash would pull from the allocations assigned to each trade page rather than the back-end logic. Basically, it would give us the ability to make manual adjustments to cash, which many Clubs have requested.\r\r\r\rLet me know if there‰Ûªs a good time in early March to discuss this new feature, and I can put together a more robust description of the desired functionality in the interim.\r\r\r\r\r\rThanks,\r\rCameron",
