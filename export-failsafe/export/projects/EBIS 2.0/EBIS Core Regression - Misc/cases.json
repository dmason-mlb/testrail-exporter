When the contract has reached those statuses, dates pop up to the right of the labels. Gina was saying that it is a bit confusing to see the labels without the dates, because it implies that the contract was signed and read when it actually wasnâ€™t. So she was wondering if the label(s) should be hidden until there is an action. I.e., it wouldnâ€™t show â€œSignedâ€� until it was actually signed on a date, it wouldnâ€™t show â€œReadâ€� until it was actually read on a date, etc.\n\nIn the attachment, right now it shows \"Signed\" but there isn't a date next to it (because it's a label).

As more Clubsâ€™ payrolls have been proximate to the CBT threshold, we would like to revisit the way we account for cash on the Payrolls reports when it is run â€œas ofâ€� a certain date. Right now, my understanding is that EBIS has some fairly convoluted back-end logic to calculate the CBT allocations on multi-year cash transactions, and thereâ€™s not really any way we can update the resulting calculations.\n\nWhat I would like to do, if possible, is apply that same logic to an additional feature on each Outright (Trade) page. What Iâ€™m envisioning, on the Mookie Betts trade as an example, would be an additional collapsible section titled â€œCash Payroll Allocationsâ€� for trades that include cash considerations. This section would have the same back-end logic that EBIS has now, except only BOC users could adjust the yearly allocations. When running payrolls â€œas ofâ€� a certain date, the cash would pull from the allocations assigned to each trade page rather than the back-end logic. Basically, it would give us the ability to make manual adjustments to cash, which many Clubs have requested.\n\nLet me know if thereâ€™s a good time in early March to discuss this new feature, and I can put together a more robust description of the desired functionality in the interim.\n\nThanks,\nCameron",

    "custom_steps": "From Mike Camillone:\r\r1)\tOne issue is that a number of fake SSNs end up getting passed to Highmark.  Since domestic players must have an SSN in their profile in order to sign a Minor League contract, in cases where they don‰Ûªt have an SSN and they need to sign a contract, BB Ops is advising Clubs to put in a dummy SSN in order to move the process along.  This is not good for Highmark as it causes the player‰Ûªs benefits account to be set up incorrectly.  Since international players do not require an SSN in order to sign, EBIS already has logic that will include the player‰Ûªs Player ID in the Highmark file if they don‰Ûªt have an SSN.  We should do this for domestic players who don‰Ûªt have SSNs.  I understand that we shouldn‰Ûªt hold up the Club from signing the contract, so maybe we can add something to the screen in EBIS to allow the Club to specify that they are waiting for the player‰Ûªs SSN; that way, the Club would not enter a fake SSN and the Highmark batch would grab the Player ID instead.\r*For #1, I‰Ûªm thinking that maybe the easiest thing to do is update the Highmark batch to grab a domestic player‰Ûªs Player ID if he doesn‰Ûªt have an SSN, the same as we do for intl players.*\r\r2)\tAnother issue is with missing addresses for players signing their first Minor League contract.  For domestic players, DPL requires the player to have at least one address, so I would expect that address to come over to his EBIS profile.  But it seems that international players may not have an address in their profile.  An example is Bryan Encarnacion (ID 811708).  When we pass address info from EBIS to Highmark, Highmark uses it to determine which coverage plan to put the player under (US/Dominican/other).  EBIS lets the user type in an address at the time of contract signing (which is what happened with Encarnacion).  Maybe the Highmark batch should also look at this address?  Or maybe this address should be put into the player‰Ûªs profile?\r*For #2, I‰Ûªm thinking that the Highmark batch should grab the contract address if an address doesn‰Ûªt exist in the player profile.*",

This change would also be helpful for many internal reporting processes.\r\r\r\rQuestions (Matt/Brian):\r\r1.\tAre we only going to do this for performance bonuses or for other addendum B clauses as well?  (If more, which ones?) \r\r2.\tAre we tracking earned information as well in addition to just the initial values? \r\r3.\tDo we want to actually check the performance bonuses against stats or are we leaving that up to users? \r\r4.\tWe won‰Ûªt be able to convert the existing data, so should we modify the existing contracts to now allow this entry or just leave them as is and let new contracts enter the data? \r\r5.\tHow do you envision this working in regards to the bonus payment tracking screen?  Is this in addition to that or integrated with it?  For major contracts the tracking info is just in line in the contract.  But some MNC clauses that already have this data (IBP, signing bonus, etc) are already tracked on the bonus payments screen \r\r6.\tDo we want to add the bonus payment tracking info into ebis link, exposing at least some of the data requested? \r\r\r\r\r\rAnswers (Cam):\r\r1)\tI think we just need clauses for performance bonuses.\r\r2)\tNo ‰ÛÒ that will be trackable via the MJ UPC.\r\r3)\tCheck in terms of whether or not they‰Ûªre earned? No, we shouldn‰Ûªt have to do that.\r\r4)\tI think just new contracts is fine for now.\r\r5)\tI haven‰Ûªt contemplated the Bonus Payment Tracking section, nor has ARI I believe.
