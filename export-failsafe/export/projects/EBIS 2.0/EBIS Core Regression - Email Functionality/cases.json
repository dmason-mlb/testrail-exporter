You'll need to complete the following before you are able to access EBIS (https://ebis.mlb.com).\r\n\r\nComplete the EBIS User Registration Form HERE as soon as possible. MLB will not be able to grant your request for access until you finish this step. Once you complete the EBIS User Registration Form you'll receive two emails: the first is confirmation that we received your request, the second is that it was approved.\r\n\r\nAFTER you receive the second email confirmation you'll need to click on the link in that email to create your password.\r\n\r\nFinally, after your account password has been created, you'll need to set up MLB's Okta Multifactor authentication app on your mobile device. Instructions on how to do that are available HERE.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact the Baseball Operations department.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nThe EBIS Team\r\n\r\n\r\n* The \"HERE\" for ebis user registration will be this link: https://clubhouse.mlb.com/UserRegistrationForm/?GROUP=EBIS2.0\r\n\r\n* The \"HERE\" for the Okta instructions will be this link: https://mlb.app.box.com/s/lzvyo3a2ma4s05nga9g8ujl4s5z88u55",
