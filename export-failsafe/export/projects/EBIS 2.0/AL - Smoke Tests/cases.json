The other columns are checkboxes. \n- None of the fields have default populations. Check boxes are unchecked by default\n- The updated column is auto-populated by system with date modified last by user\n- Last Name, First name and Title are required fields. If user hits Save, the rows that are missing these fields, show hard error for these required fields. See #104727464 for more details on how this error should work.\n- Success notifications and errors must follow the global framework in terms of look and feel and workflow\n- Required fields should have a red \"*\" to the right of the column header that is only visible if one more columns is in edit mode\n- Checkmarks in view mode should use the proper font-awesome icon, font-size and color",
