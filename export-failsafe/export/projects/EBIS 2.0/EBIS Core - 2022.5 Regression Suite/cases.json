That request was for the 6/7 bulletin.  The next morning, OAK entered another OR waiver request for Merkel at 11:18 am on 6/6.  That request was for the 6/6 bulletin.  The 6/6 bulletin was sent successfully yesterday, but the Merkel OR request for 6/7 remains on todayâ€™s bulletin.  Wanted to show you this before we deleted that entry.\n\nCan we get some logic in place where a Club can not enter the same same type of waiver request (OR or UR) after that request has already been submitted?\n\nAdditionally, can we eliminate the ability for a Club to request any waiver for a day other than for the next scheduled bulletin?  All requests submitted should be for the next bulletin to be sent.  Between 2 pm ET Monday and 1:59 pm Tuesday, all waiver requests that are entered are for that Tuesdayâ€™ bulletin.  Clubs should not be able to enter a waiver request during that time for any bulletin other than Tuesdayâ€™s.\n\nThanks",
