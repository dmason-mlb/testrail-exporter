It does not prevent a user from putting the form in edit mode\n- If user hits Cancel, do not save the users changes.\n- If the user hits Ignore and Continue, then save the user's changes but withdraw the PDF from E-sig state.\n- If the PDF is withdrawn, the user is allowed to submit for e-sig again or upload a PDF.\n- Withdrawn PDFs should no longer show in the Player or Club e-signature widgets\n\nUsers can also cancel e-signature by doing the following: \n- Clicking the \"E-Sign\" button on a transaction that has been submitted for e-sig opens a modal that contains a \"Cancel E-Signature\" button available on the modal.\n* Clicking \"Cancel E-Signature\" will prompt the user to confirm that they wish to cancel the e-signature process (see comments). \n* If they do not confirm, then the user is returned to the form and the e-signature process is not cancelled.\n* If they do confirm, then the form is withdrawn from e-signature and no longer appears in any of the e-signature widgets. The user is now able to restart the e-signature process by clicking \"E-sign\" on the form again if they wish.",
