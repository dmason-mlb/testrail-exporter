From the quick menu,\r\n     select \"Enter Rest Mode\". Especially perform the check in sections where \r\n     the online mode/network feature is used.\r\n     Note that it is also possible to transition once to the home screen and\r\n     then to transition to the rest mode. Also test this case if the application\r\n     changes behavior when it is running in the background.\r\n\r\n (5) Press the PS button and return from the rest mode.\r\n     When using RTC/TSC, to detect a bug in the usage, leave the TestKit in\r\n     the rest mode for a long time. Choose a time duration that is appropriate\r\n     according to application specifications, for example, the time required\r\n     to discard a network authentication ticket.\r\n",
