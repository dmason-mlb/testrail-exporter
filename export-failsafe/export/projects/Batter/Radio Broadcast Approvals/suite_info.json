  "description": "GOAL: The MLB Broadcast and Scheduling team wants to bring the Radio Station Broadcaster approval process into BATTER. \r\n\r\nThe Broadcast team wants visibility into radio station broadcast approvals. In order to do this, we will introduce a feature to BATTER which allows clubs to sort through and approve visiting radio broadcasters that are based more than 50 miles from the visiting teamâ€™s home ballpark. Once approvals are confirmed, visiting broadcasters will be notified of their approval status. This feature will allow clubs to digitize a process that relies heavily on paper trails and email chains, while granting the broadcast team assurance that all radio broadcasts are by the books.",
