In order to do this, we will introduce a feature to BATTER which allows clubs to sort through and approve visiting radio broadcasters that are based more than 50 miles from the visiting teamâ€™s home ballpark. Once approvals are confirmed, visiting broadcasters will be notified of their approval status. This feature will allow clubs to digitize a process that relies heavily on paper trails and email chains, while granting the broadcast team assurance that all radio broadcasts are by the books.",
