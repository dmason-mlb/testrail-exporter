  "description": "For some of the test cases in this section, you must have access to the MLB App Tools - QA. The changes done at the client cannot be proxied since the call is signed by the HTTP client at the origin. So, to test these, you must login to the tool and make the changes manually and then verify the changes in the app. Once you made your changes in the tool, publish them to QA and give it a minute for the system to update. Then relaunch the app and the changes should be reflecting in the app.\r\nCheck out this short video on how to test with the config changes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBbUxPMVmSJPFUjyr2ucRXme2p_lsdnf/view?usp=sharing",
