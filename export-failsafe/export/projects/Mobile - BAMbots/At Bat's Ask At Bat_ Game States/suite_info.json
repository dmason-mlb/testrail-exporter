While some custom work to handle stats deep links has been done to allow those links the be processed in a custom manner, we need to ensure any deep links returned by the service can be handled by Ask At Bat by directing the user to the page indicated in the link.\r\n\r\nWiki:\r\nhttps://wiki.mlbam.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SD&title=Stats+Leaders\r\nhttps://wiki.mlbam.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=mobile&title=At+Bat+-+Question+Bot+-+Phase+1\r\n\r\nDesigns:\r\niOS - https://app.zeplin.io/project/59a72cd508f6e486f47ebd54\r\nAndroid - https://app.zeplin.io/project/59a72cba458184fde6e5c524",
