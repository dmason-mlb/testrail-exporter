  "description": "Vendors integrating with Ballpark want to be able to create concepts that depend on access to a device camera. Due to the vendor program limiting these concepts to webviews only, they require access to the camera while inside the app (instead of using native camera outside of the app for deeplinking purposes)\r\n\r\nAs a fan attending a ballpark, I want to be able to scan codes around the park within the Ballpark app to engage with AR features and access custom payment methods",
