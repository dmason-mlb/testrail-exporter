For details on \"Voice Recognition Title Name\", refer to \"Voice Recognition Title Name User's Guide\". Up to three voice recognition title names can be set for each language supported by voice recognition.\n\nTo avoid end user confusion, a number representing a series or a number/expression representing a year alone must be prevented from being set as a voice recognition title name. Because there are many applications that include \"2015\", \"III\", and \"2K14\"; when only setting these as voice recognition texts, multiple applications will be applicable and user experience will be compromised.\n\nNote that languages according to sales region are required. For example, setting an English (UK) voice recognition title name will be required for SIEE applications, even for applications that only support Spanish.\n\nThe use of hiragana and katakana is recommended for Japanese phoneme creation. A phoneme created with Japanese set does not violate this requirement even if romaji or English spelling is used; however, recognition precision may deteriorate.\n\nIf it will be difficult to conform to this requirement in applications that re-use masters, contact Private Support through the PlayStation®4 Developer Network website (https://ps4.scedev.net//) in advance.\n",

If the language set does not exist for the title name in param.sfo, the default title name will apply.\nSetting a Japanese voice recognition title name is required for SIEJ, even for titles where the title name is English only.

The error message can be displayed in the VR headset or the social screen depending on the application's functionality. However, the HmdSetupDialog is not displayed on the social screen in the separate mode. Note that the social screen must be set to mirroring mode in order to display an error message on it using HmdSetupDialog.\n\nIn addition, when a user reconnects the cable, applications are required to make the VR headset usable without the application restarting.

Therefore, the confirmation of R4096C and R4096E is not necessary.

The following indicators can be used to establish if save data memory is supported.
