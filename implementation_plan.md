# TestRail Exporter Implementation Plan

## Overview
This application will allow users to export test cases from TestRail for later importing into X-ray. The application will provide a GUI interface for selecting projects, suites, and sections, and will export the selected test cases to a JSON file.

## Architecture
The application will be built using Python with the following components:
- **GUI Framework**: We'll use Tkinter for the GUI components as it's included in Python's standard library
- **API Client**: A client for interacting with the TestRail API
- **Data Models**: Classes to represent TestRail entities (projects, suites, sections, cases)
- **Export Module**: Logic for exporting selected test cases to JSON

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and TestRail API Client
- Create project structure
- Implement TestRail API client with the following methods:
  - `get_projects()`: Retrieve all projects
  - `get_suites(project_id)`: Retrieve all suites for a project
  - `get_sections(project_id, suite_id)`: Retrieve all sections for a suite
  - `get_cases(project_id, suite_id, section_id=None)`: Retrieve test cases

### Phase 2: GUI Implementation
- Create main application window
- Implement settings panel for TestRail URL, username, and API key
- Create projects dropdown
- Implement suite and section tree view with checkboxes
- Add "Expand All", "Collapse All", "Check All", "Uncheck All", and "Export" buttons
- Add loading indicator for API calls

### Phase 3: Export Functionality
- Implement logic to collect selected suites and sections
- Retrieve test cases for selected suites/sections
- Generate JSON output
- Add file save dialog for export
- Implement progress indicator during export

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Polish
- Add error handling for API calls
- Implement input validation
- Add status messages for user feedback
- Polish UI and improve user experience

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in standard library)
- Requests (for API calls)

```

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of UI components and interactions
- Unit tests for API client
- Integration tests for export functionality

## Future Enhancements
- Export to CSV format compatible with X-ray
- Save/load export configuration
- Filter test cases by additional criteria
